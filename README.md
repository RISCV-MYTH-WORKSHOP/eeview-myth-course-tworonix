# My solutions to the workshop exercises
This repository contains my solutions: a calculator and a RISC-V implementation. See below for information and links about the workshop.

My RISC-V has all the features explained in the workshop - pipelines, jumps, loads and stores (full word only). The design worked both in Makerchip and when flashed on a real FPGA (provided in the workshop). It passed all 4 test case files included in the workshop.

Be warned that the quality of the code probably isn't the greatest, as it was my first project in any hardware description language.


# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

For students of ["Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours/THree weeks" (MYTH) Workshop](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/riscv-based-myth/), offered by [Redwood EDA](https://www.redwoodeda.com/) and training partners [VLSI System Design (VSD)](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/) and [The EEView](https://theeeview.com).

## About the Workshop

This workshop has recieved a great deal of attention in the RISC-V community for enabling students to learn at a pace never before possible through the use of TL-Verilog and [Makerchip](https://www.makerchip.com). Some links:
